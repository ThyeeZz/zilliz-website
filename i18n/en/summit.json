    "title": "Vector world: new database era",
    "desc1": "In today's rapidly growing Internet, 80% of human society's data exists in the form of unstructured data, which is not effectively utilized. In the past decades, computers have been able to efficiently process structured data such as numerical values and text, but lack effective methods for unstructured data such as images, videos, behavioral portraits, 3D structures of compounds and gene sequences, which are widely available.",
    "desc2": "IDC observes and predicts that between 2018 and 2025, the amount of data generated globally will grow from 33 ZB to 175 ZB, a compound growth rate of 27%, of which more than 80% will be unstructured data that is more difficult to process. It is expected that by 2030, the global data volume will reach 3,5000 EB. Unstructured data has its own characteristics that are difficult to manage, so it is the biggest challenge for enterprises to handle unstructured data well.",
    "desc3": "How to use vectors to retrieve huge amount of unstructured data? What are the advantages and prospects of vector databases, and how to use large-scale deep learning networks to achieve innovation and application of algorithms and models in the field of data in the AI era? How should an open source database come out of the loop in 2022? If you are also interested or even fascinated by these questions, please join us to explore the cutting-edge data science field."
