    "title": "Why Milvus?",
    "desc1": "It is simple to start building a prototype for similarity search, but it is hard to put into production. Embeddings, being highly complex, multi-coordinate numbers, are not well suited to legacy, tabular data structures. Some developers use vector libraries to store vector embeddings in in-memory indexes to perform similarity searches.",
    "desc2": "However, updating the index is non-trivial and requires vector workflow tools inherent in vector databases. And to top it off, building a solution to host vectors rapidly becomes costly when solving the scale requirement."
